# SAHYOG- It is our time to step up the game!

An assisting website for highschool students and the undergrad students who are beginning their journey in tech. Through this platform they can find mentors for themselves and develop enthusiasm to learn. India is a country which is known for producing maximum number of engineers, but not quality engineers. High school students are not introduced to the latest tech and a lot of colleges do not have a healthy learning community. Sahyog gives a platform to such people to grab knowledge from students/seniors who have already been in the tech journey for a while now and wishes to mentor.  

# What does the news articles say?
* Over half of Indian students will not have skills for 21st century jobs, warns UNICEF
* Over 80% Indian engineers are unemployable, lack new-age technology skill.


# Gifted Potential and Unavailability Of An Appropriate Society: A Call for Extraordinary Action

# Learnings From the project

Being a first year student, it was a great and a blissful experience for me to learn a variety of new domains like backend development in web, front end development of the web, designing the web, managing a variety of tasks at a time, working as a team and collaborating with each other, new experiences of open source learning from a variety of sites and learning languages like Node JS, and Javascrpit.


# Challenges Faced:

We as team did our best to meet the highest expectations we could in our very first 36 hours hackathon.

We tried to implement our idea and present it in the best possible way in a given time and and present knowledge and gained knowledge during my hack.

I mostly faced challenges in redirecting the routes to diferrent buttons during my work. Moreoever, I and my team were not able to link many css to the js files due to routing issues which were successfully solved after a lot of efforts.

I faced a major challenge to postion my frontend elements in a appealing manner to my web page which were solved hours after effort.
